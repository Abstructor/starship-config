## Linux Configuration, Fast
# Okay, what are the differences between "Fast" and "Standard"?
#   "Standard" uses normal Starship language detection.
#   This has a side effect of triggering (languagebinary) (--version|-v) yadayadayada
#   The "Fast" version does not have that trigger, removing the version check, making it "faster" since
#   the version string received from Starship is left unused anyways.
